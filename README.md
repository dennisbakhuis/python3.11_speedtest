# Speed test for Python 3.11
I created a simple speed test to compare Python 3.11 to 3.10 (and 3.9 .. 3.5).
The tests use a Monte Carlo Pi estimation. This is probably not the best workload for a full Python stress test.

## Calculated results by continuous integration
You can see [the latest results](https://github.com/dennisbakhuis/python3.11_speedtest/actions/workflows/run.yml) in Github Actions for different languages as
well as different versions of Python. The results are collected in a JSON artifact. Below is an example output:

## Run original test using Docker
### Requirements
- Python environment to run the tester
- Docker to download each Python Env.

### Usage:
```bash
cd pi_estimates/Python
python run_main_test.py
```

## Original results
